  abstract =	"This tutorial is designed to give the reader an
		 understanding of Principal Components Analysis (PCA).
		 PCA is a useful statistical technique that has found
		 application in fields such as face recognition and
		 image compression, and is a common technique for
		 finding patterns in data of high dimension.\\
		 Before getting to a description of PCA, this tutorial
		 first introduces mathematical concepts that will be
		 used in PCA. It covers standard deviation, covariance,
		 eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This background knowledge
		 is meant to make the PCA section very straightforward,
		 but can be skipped if the concepts are already
		 familiar.\\ There are examples all the way through this
		 tutorial that are meant to illustrate the concepts
		 being discussed. If further information is required,
		 the mathematics textbook {"}Elementary Linear Algebra
		 5e{"} by Howard Anton, Publisher John Wiley \& Sons
		 Inc, ISBN 0-471-85223-6 is a good source of information
		 regarding the mathematical background.",
